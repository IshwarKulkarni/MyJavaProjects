This is mandelbrot set code I had written back in early engineering, discovering the fresh new world of Java. 
I also happened to have started reading the Book "Chaos" by James Gleick, so naturally I was drawn towards mandelbrots, julia sets and lorentz attractors. Putting two together, wrote this code down. 

Looking back at the code I feel either I have learnt a lot in programming or none at all.. truth is probably somewhere in the middle.

I won't be adding pushing to this
